Description
-----------------
Hi.  I'm a CrankedBlue, a WordPress theme created by John Endicott (crankedapps.com).  I am built on HTML5/CSS3 and fully responsive to mobile screen dimensions.  You can easily upload your own logo, upload a header showcase image, change theme colors, and more from the customizer.  I am also bundled with the Font Awesome v4 icon pack.  Check out the live demo here: https://crankedapps.com/projects/crankedblue/

Getting Started
-----------------
Upload entire 'crankedblue' folder into wp-content/themes/ and activate it in WordPress admin panel.  Use customizer in WordPress admin to manage logos, header image, and theme colors.


TIPS
-----------------
1) Add title attributes to menu items (WP Admin -> Menu -> Screen Options -> Check "Title Attribute", add titles to all menu items - this makes the bold effect when hovering on links in nav menu appear cleaner
